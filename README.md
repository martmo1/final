The 'jump' file is an assignment that uses the file provided by the professor and makes it look like the Pickman character is jumping.

The 'game' file is a task to implement any game using turtle.
The game I made is a game where you catch a ball with a stick and keep bouncing it off without stopping.
It was produced using the image file used in the 'jump' file
